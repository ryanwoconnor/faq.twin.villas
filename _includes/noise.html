<h3 id="noise">Noise</h3>
<p>You're more than welcome to enjoy the property and have a good time, but we thank you in advance for keeping noise to a low volume.

<p> We have a quiet space here and have had no noise complaints from any of the neighbors or guests - and we intend to keep it that way. </p>

<p>If you plan to play music, keep it at a low volume. There should be no bluetooth speakers being used in any outdoor spaces as not everyone may want to hear the same music as you do. </p>
