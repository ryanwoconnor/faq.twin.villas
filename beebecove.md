2. Do I need to feed the fish?
    * You do not need to feed the fish! They are fed regularly with pellets. When they are not fed pellets, they still enjoy feeding off of organic matter. 

3. There is someone outside mowing the lawn. Do I need to be alarmed?
    * You do not need to be worried. Changes are it is your host stopping by and chances are I've also sent you a message in advance. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause.
