<h3 id="grill">Grill</h3>
<p>The grill outside is available for use. If there is not propane for some reason, please let me know and I'll do my best to fill it ASAP. You can also fill the tank at a number of places in town and I will gladly pay you back immediately through Airbnb or Venmo. Please also abide by the following rules: </p>
<ul>
<li>Grill should be monitored and attended at all times. Do leave grill unattended for any reason. For example: Do not attempt to cook ribs and leave the grill on for several hours. </li>
<li>After use, please ensure the propane is <strong>completely</strong> shut off using the knobs, as well as on the tank itself.</li>
<li>Please ensure all utensils are removed from the grill, and brought back to the Airbnb once you are done. This includes any forks, knives, spatulas, etc.</li>
<li>Do not leave any food on the grill after you're done using it.</li>
<li>Please cover the grill once it has cooled down.</li>
</ul>
