### FAQ

1. How do I turn on the overhead fan?
    * You should see a circle shaped light switch behind the lamp next to the couch. This switch controls the overhead fan. Note that it does not control the speed of the fan. The fan is either on or off. 


2. Is there cable TV?
    * We do not have Cable TV at this listing. There are plenty of streaming apps available on the Roku TV in the living room. 

3. There is someone outside mowing the lawn. Do I need to be alarmed?
    * You do not need to be worried. Changes are it is your host stopping by and chances are I've also sent you a message in advance. Apologies for any inconvenience this may cause. 

4. There is someone outside by the pool. Do I need to be alarmed?
    * As described in the listing when you booked, the pool area is a shared space. As a result, you will likely encounter people out there. There should not be any parties, loud music, drinking, smoking, or other dangerous activities taking place by the pool. All guests should be following the posted pool rules. If at any time you are concerned for your safety, or the safety of others, please contact your host immediately.
