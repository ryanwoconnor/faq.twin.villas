### FAQ

1. There is someone outside by the pool. Do I need to be alarmed?
    * As described in the listing when you booked, the pool area is a shared space. As a result, you will likely encounter people out there. There should not be any parties, loud music, drinking, smoking, or other dangerous activities taking place by the pool. All guests should be following the posted pool rules. If at any time you are concerned for your safety, or the safety of others, please contact your host immediately. 
    
2. Will I have the entire house to myself?
    * As described in the listing, this is a separate upstairs apartment overlooking multiple beautiful farms in Stonington, CT.  The apartment is zoned separately from the main floor of the house where I live. There is a separate entrance and set of stairs up to the private apartment. There are no shared living spaces. You will have your own kitchen, living room, bathroom, bedrooms, and deck (including a propane fire table). That being said, you do have access to the entire outside property (3.5 acres) with this reservation and at times these spaces are shared with myself or other friends/guests. 

3. Can I use the pool?
    * Absolutely you are allowed to use the pool. Our list of pool rules can be [found here.](/rusticretreat/poolrules)
